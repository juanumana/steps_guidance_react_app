# Under Construction: After Login the next Screen should be a Home Screen (where all the funtionalities are). The guidance should not start every time, obviously. May be only the first time he accesses, once the user has entered his information. 

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Serve on localhost:3000
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build
```
